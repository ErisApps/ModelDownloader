- Sorting (newest/oldest/name/author) and searching
- Previews for sabers and notes to preview them before downloading
- Automatic model previews are supported, but need to be enabled in Mod Settings
- A page with the modeler's other models that can be accessed by clicking their name on the preview
- Warnings for downloading a model that you don't have the mod installed for
- Automatic model detection that grays out models you already have installed

## Installation and usage
This mod requires SiraUtil and BSML, both of which can be installed easily with [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).

You can install this mod by extracting the ZIP directly into your Beat Saber folder. If you're not sure where your Beat Saber folder is, it's explained on the [BSMG wiki here](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#default-location).
